# Why Causality?

- Many of the interesting questions we might want to answer with data are causal<sup>1</sup>

- Some are non-causal, too - for example, "how can we predict whether this photo is of a dog or a cat" is vital to how Google Images works, but it doesn't care what *caused* the photo to be of a dog or a cat

- Nearly every *why* question is causal

- *Why* is a first order question for any policy maker thinking about a new policy.

---

# Also

- This is economists' comparative advantage!

- Plenty of fields do statistics. But very few make it standard training for their students to understand causality

- This understanding of causality makes economists very useful! *This* is one big reason why tech companies have whole economics departments in them

---

# So what is causality?

- We say that `X` *causes* `Y` if...

- were we to intervene and *change* the value of `X` without changing anything else...

- then `Y` would also change as a result

---

# Some examples of causal relationships

.pull-left[
## Some Obvious:

- A light switch being set to on causes the light to be on

- Setting off fireworks raises the noise level

]

--

.pull-right[

## Some less obvious:

- Getting a college degree increases your earnings

- Tariffs reduce the amount of trade

]

---

# Correlation vs Causation

* That's becomes almost a trueism: *Correlation is not equal Causation*.

* Well, we're here to figure out conditions when it **is**!

## Examples of non-zero *correlations* that are not *causal* (or may be causal in the wrong direction!)

.pull-left[

### Some obvious:

- People tend to wear shorts on days when ice cream trucks are out

- Rooster crowing sounds are followed closely by sunrise

] 

.pull-right[

### Some less obvious:

- Colds tend to clear up a few days after you take Emergen-C

- The performance of the economy tends to be lower or higher depending on the president's political party

# [Spurious](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) Correlation?

![](../img/photos/spurious.png)

---

# Good and Bad Correlation?

* *Correlation* is a well-defined concept of statistical **association**

* It's clearly true that space launches and Sociology doctorates have a correlation coefficient of 78%.

* However, what relationship lies **behind** this association is a more difficult question. 

* In other words, what does it **mean** to measure a correlation between two variables?

---


# Important Note

- "X causes Y" *doesn't* mean that X is necessarily the *only* thing that causes Y

- And it *doesn't* mean that all Y must be X

- For example, using a light switch causes the light to go on

- But not if the bulb is burned out (no Y, despite X), or if the light was already on (Y without X)

- But still we'd say that using the switch causes the light! The important thing is that X *changes the probability* that Y happens, not that it necessarily makes it happen for certain


---

# So How Can We Tell?

- As just shown, there are plenty of *correlations* that aren't *causal*

- So if we have a correlation, how can we tell if it *is*?

- For this we're going to have to think hard about *causal inference*. That is, inferring causality from data.

# The Problem of Causal Inference

.pull-left[
- Let's try to think about whether some `X` causes `Y`

- That is, if we manipulated `X`, then `Y` would change as a result

- For simplicity, let's assume that `X` is either 1 or 0, like "got a medical treatment" or "didn't"

]

--

.pull-right[

## The Problem of Causal Inference

- Now, how can we know *what would happen* if we manipulated `X`?

- Let's consider just one person - Angela. We could just check what Angela's `Y` is when we make `X=0`, and then check what Angela's `Y` is again when we make `X=1`.

- Are those two `Y`s different? If so, `X` causes `Y`!

- Do that same process for everyone in your sample and you know in general what the effect of `X` on `Y` is.

]

---

# The Problem of Causal Inference


- You may have spotted the problem!

- Just like you can't be in two places at once, Angela can't exist both with `X=0` and with `X=1`. She either got that medical treatment or she didn't.

- Let's say she did. So for Angela, `X=1` and, let's say, her outcome is `Y=10`.

- The other one, what `Y` *would have been* if we made `X=0`, is **missing**. 

- We don't know what it is! Could also be `Y=10`. Could be `Y=9`. Could be `Y=1000`!


---


# The Problem of Causal Inference

- Well, why don't we just take someone who actually DOES have `X=0` and compare their `Y`?

- Because there are lots of reasons their `Y` could be different BESIDES `X`.

- They're not Angela! A character flaw to be sure. `r emo::ji("grinning")`

- So if we find someone, Gareth, with `X=0` and they have `Y=9`, is that because `X` increases `Y`, or is that just because Angela and Gareth would have had different `Y`s anyway?

---


# The Problem of Causal Inference

- The main goal we have in doing causal inference is in making *as good a guess as possible* as to what that `Y` *would have been* if `X` had been different.

- That "would have been" is called a *counterfactual* - counter to the fact of what actually happened.

- In doing so, we want to think about two people/firms/countries that are basically *exactly the same* except that one has `X=0` and one has `X=1`.

- If we could, we'd pick someone *identical* to Angela, the only difference being that they had `X=0` and not `X=1`.

# Experiments

# Experiments

.pull-left[
- A common way to do this in many fields is an *experiment*.

- If you can *randomly assign* `X`, then you know that the people with `X=0` are, on average, exactly the same as the people with `X=1`.

- So that's an easy comparison!

]

--

.pull-right[


- When we're working with people/firms/countries, running experiments is often infeasible, impossible, or unethical.

- So we have to think hard about a *model* of what the world looks like.

- So that we can use our model to figure out what the *counterfactual* would be.

# Back to class size and students' achievements

In past session we regress some average student standardized score on class size. 

$$\textrm{avg_math_score}_i = b_0 + b_1 \textrm{class_size}_i + e_i$$
Do you think $b_1$ is measuring the causal impact of class size on students' math score? If not, why ? 

--

* Students sorting : There is selection into schools with different sized classes. Suppose parents have a prior that smaller classes are better - they will try to get their kids into those schools.

--

* Teachers sorting : teachers could sort towards schools with smaller classes because itâ€™s easier to teach a small rather than a large class, and if there is competition for those places and higher quality teachers will have an advantage.

--

If you were asked to think of an experiment that captures the influence of class size on student performance, what would it be?

# The STAR Experiment (1/5)
(Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio Experiment)

* Starting in 1985-1986 and lasting for four years, young pupils starting Kindergarden and their teachers where randomly allocated to to several possible groups : 

1. Small classes with 13-17 students
2. Regular classes with 22-25 students
3. Regular classes with 22-25 students but with an additional full-time teaching aide.

* Randomization at the school level (i.e. students and teachers of a given school are randomized across class types)

* Let's take their data and replicate some of the experimental findings!

# Models

- In causal inference, the *model* is our idea of what we think the process is that *generated the data*.

- We have to make some assumptions about what this is!

- We put together what we know about the world with assumptions and end up with our model.

- The model can then tell us what kinds of things could give us wrong results so we can fix them and get the right counterfactual.

---

# Models

- Wouldn't it be nice to not have to make assumptions?

- Yeah, but it's impossible to skip!

- We're trying to predict something tat hasn't happened - a counterfactual.

- This is literally impossible to do if you don't have some model of how the data is generated.

- You can't even predict the sun will rise tomorrow without a model!

- If you think you can, you're just don't realize the model you're using - that's dangerous!

---

# An Example: Randomization

- Let's generate some data.
- Let's say that getting `X` causes `Y` to increase by 100.
- And let's run a randomized experiment of who actually gets X and estimate the size of the effect (should be close to `100`!)

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
true_effect <- 100
df <- tibble(Y.without.X = rnorm(1000),
             X=sample(c(0,1),1000,replace=T)) %>%
  mutate(Y.with.X = Y.without.X + true_effect) %>%
  #Now assign who actually gets X
  mutate(Observed.Y = ifelse(X==1,Y.with.X,Y.without.X))
head(df,4)
```
]

.pull-right[
* Now, estimate the group means and simply difference them:
```{r}
#And see what effect our experiment suggests X has on Y
df %>% group_by(X) %>% 
  summarize(Y = mean(Observed.Y)) %>%
  pull(Y) %>% diff
```
]

* That's pretty close to the true effect there!

---

# An Example: No Randomization

- Suppose now we can *not* randomize the `X`.

- Instead there is some kind of rule that decides about `X`.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
df <- tibble(Z = runif(10000)) %>% 
  mutate(Y.without.X = rnorm(10000)+100*Z, 
         Y.with.X = Y.without.X + 100) %>%
  #Now assign who actually gets X
  mutate(X = Z > .9,
         Observed.Y = ifelse(X==1,Y.with.X,Y.without.X))
head(df)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

```{r}
df %>% group_by(X) %>% 
  summarize(Y = mean(Observed.Y)) %>%
  pull(Y) %>% diff
```

* That's not the correct effect size!

* But if we properly model the assignment process and compare apples to apples?

```{r}
df %>% filter(abs(Z-.9)<.01) %>% 
  group_by(X) %>% 
  summarize(Y = mean(Observed.Y)) %>%
  pull(Y) %>% diff
```
]

---

# Building the Counterfactual

* In that last example our first attempt failed because we had not taken selection into account.

* It turns out that `Z` influences `Y.without.X`, which at the same time will be part of our estimator for the true effect size.

* But `Z` also determines who gets treatment! All the ones with `Z > 0.9`!

* So, people with `Z > 0.9` get treated, but **also** have a relatively high `Y.without.X`. 

* You can see that there is a depenence between the assignment and the effect size.
