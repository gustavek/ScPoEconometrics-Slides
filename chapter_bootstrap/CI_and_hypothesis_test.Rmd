# Where Did We Stop Last Week?


* Last week we learned about **sampling distributions**

* We took repeated **random samples** from a our **population** (i.e. our pasta bowl)

  * For each sample, we computed the **sample estimate** $\hat{p}$ of the proportion of green pasta in the bowl $p$, i.e. the true value. 

* Looking at the resulting sampling distribution, we saw that it is **normally shaped around the true value**. 
  * Random sampling produces **unbiased estiamtes**. 
  
* We also illustrated the role of sample size: as we consider samples of bigger size, the sampling distribution is **narrower**. 

  * In other words, the **standard deviation of the sample estimate** decreases.

* Overall, looking at the sampling distribution it seemed fairly easy to infer what the true proportion of green pasta was.

# Back to reality

.pull-right[

* In real life we only get to take **one** sample from the population.

  * So nobody could ever take **1000** samples from the population!

* Also, we obviously don't know about the true proportion of green pasta!
  
  * That's the object of our interest. 

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun Only?! ðŸ˜§.

]

* Well, even unobserved, we **know** that the sampling distribution does exist, and even better, we know how it behaves!

* Let's see what we can do with this...

# From Point Estimate to Confidence Intervals

* From now, we only get **point estimates** from our samples: either simple statistics like *means* or *proportions* or *regression coefficients*

  * From a pasta sample, we get $\hat{p}$: the proportion of green pasta in that sample. 

* We know that this sample estimate differs from the true population parameter because of sampling variation. 

* The question is how much. **What could be plausible values for the popluation parameter given the data we have?** 

* A **Confidence Interval** provides an estimate for this range of plausible values. 

  * The point estimate is our best guess for the popluation parameter

  * The confidence interval will tell us how confident we can be that the true value is close to our estimate.

---

# Constructing Confidence Intervals 

* There are several approaches to construct CI's:
    
    1. *Theory*: Use mathematical formulas (**Central Limit Theorem**) to derive the sampling distributions for our estimators under certain conditions.
    
    1. *Simulation.* We can use the **Bootstrap** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution.
    
* We'll focus on the bootstrap to give you the intuition and come back to the maths approach later.

* But first: what is a *bootstrap*?

---


# Boostrapping our pasta sample #1

* We are working as in real life now, so we have access to *only one random sample*.

  * Here it is, a sample of 40 pasta randomly drawn from our bowl:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bowl <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpjsk0rfgc0gx80/pasta.csv?dl=1")
p = mean(bowl$color=="green")
set.seed(5)

my_sample = bowl %>%
  mutate(color = as.factor(ifelse(color == "green","green","non-green"))) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 40) %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)
p_hat = mean(my_sample$color=="green")

bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

percentile_95ci = get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_distrib, level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_95lb = percentile_95ci[[1]]
percentile_95ub = percentile_95ci[[2]]

paste0("ID ", my_sample$pasta_ID, ": ", my_sample$color)
```


* The proportion of green pasta in this sample is: $\hat{p} = `r p_hat`$.

* We are going to resample **WITH REPLACEMENT** from our sample.

* ***Intuition***: Our sample becomes our population and we draw samples from it to construct a simulated distribution.

# Boostrapping our pasta sample #2

* How do we get 1 boostrapped sample:
  
  1. Randomly pick one pasta from your sample and record the associated color.
  1. Put this pasta back in your sample and shake up the bowl.
  1. Repeat step 1 to 2 24 times
  1. Compute the bootstrapped sample estimate, e.g. *the proportion of green pasta*

* Here is one bootstrapped sample: 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(5)
one_bootstrapp = my_sample %>%
    ungroup() %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 40, replace = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)
paste0("ID ", one_bootstrapp$pasta_ID, ": ", one_bootstrapp$color)
```

* You can notice that:
  * Several pasta have been drawn multiple times (ID=128,149,...)!
  * All have been draw from our initial sample
  * The bootstrapped sample size is equal to our initial sample size. 
---

# Bootstrapping our pasta sample in R



* Repeating the whole procedure 1000 times, you will get 1000 bootsrapped samples and 1000 bootstrapped estimates! 

* We use the `infer` package that makes the whole bootstrapping procedure easier. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% # generate 1000 boostrapped samples 
  calculate(stat = "prop") # calculate the proportion of green pasta for each
```

# Building a 95% confidence interval

.pull-left[

* Let's define an interval that covers 95% of our bootstrapped estimates. 

* We get it by cutting the boostrap distribution at the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles

* It defines our 95% bootstrap CI as: $$CI^B = [q_{2,5\%} ; q_{97,5\%}]$$

# Interpreting a 95% confidence interval #1

# Recap Confidence Interval

* A CI gives us a range of plausible values for our parameter of interest.

* In order to construct a confidence cnterval, we need: 
  
  1. An underlying **sampling distribution of the estimate**, either boostrapped as in our example, or derived from theory.
  
  2. To specify a **confidence level**, like 90%, 95% etc. 
  
* For the 95% level, we say that we are **95% confident that the interval contains the true parameter** because it actually does in 95% of the cases. 

* *Question* 

  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when setting higher levels of confidence? 
  
  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when the sample size increases?

# Is There Gender Discrimination In Promotions?

.left-wide[
* We will use data from an [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/39f6/d40e907ff08af4ddd3280c2ceee55ee1ddb6.pdf) published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* in 1974 which investigates whether female employees at Banks are discriminated against.

* 48 (male) supervisors were given *identical* candidate CVs - identical up to the first name, which was male or female. 

  * Each CV was "*in the form of a memorandum requesting a decision on the promotion of an employee to the position of branch manager*";

* **Hypothesis** we want to test : *Is there gender discrimination?*

* The data from the experiment are provided in the `promotions` dataset from the `moderndive` package.

# Hypothesis testing: Basic idea 

The idea of hypothesis tests is quite simple: 

1. We asusme that the hypothesis we want to test is true. 

  * In our case: There is no gender discrimination in promotions. 

1. Then we look how consistent are our data in this world. 

  * In our case: We gonna ask how likely it is to get a 29%p difference in promotion rate if there is no discrimination.

# Recap

* We observed a 29%p difference in promotion rate between women and men in the real world.

* Even if promotions had been randomly allocated between men and women, a difference would have been observed.

* The question is whether in a hypothetical universe with no discrimination, 29%p is *likely* to occur.

* We concluded *rather not*, i.e. we tended to **reject** that hypothesis.

* So, we conducted our first hypothesis test! 

  * We actually did a **permutation test**. We randomly reshuffled gender accross promotion decisions and checked if it makes a difference.

* Let's introduce the formal framework of hypothesis test now. 

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #1

* In Hypothesis testing we compare two **competing hypothesis** about our parameter of interest. 
    * In the previous example:
        $$\begin{align}H_0:& p_m - p_f = 0\\H_A:& p_m - p_f > 0\end{align}$$

* $H_0$ stands for the **null hypothesis**, where *no effect* is observed. That's our hypothetical world from above.

* $H_A$ or $H_1$ is the **alternative** hypothesis. 
  * Here, we considered a *one-sided* alternative, saying that $p_m > p_f$, ie women are discriminated against.
  * The *two-sided* formulation is just $H_A: p_m - p_f \neq 0$

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #2

* A **test statistic** is a summary statistic which we use to summarise a certain aspect of our sample. 
  * In our previous case it was: $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$

* The *observed test statistic* is the number we get from our real world sample: 
$$\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f = 29.2\%$$

* The **null distribution** is the sampling distribution of our test statistic, assuming the Null hypothesis is **true**. 
  *  All the possible values that $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$ assuming there is no discrimination.

  * That's the distribution we have seen just before. 
 
---

# Null Distribution

.left-wide[
```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height=5}
visualize(null_distribution, bins = 10, fill = "darkgreen") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.292, col = "red", size =1.5) +

  theme_bw(base_size = 15)
```
]

.right-thin[
</br>
* This **is** the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$, assuming $H_0$ is true.

* The red line is the *observed* test statistic.
]

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #3

* The **p-value** is the probability of observing a test statistic *more extreme* than the one we obtained, assuming $H_0$ is true. `r emo::ji("thinking")`

  * How *strong* a piece of evidence is it to observe $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f=29\%$ in a world where $p_m - p_f=0$ is assumed true? Very strong? Not so strong?

  * How many samples did we obtain that had a difference *greater* than 29%? Many, or not so many?

* The p-value measures the probability to the right of the red line in the previous plot.

* *Interpretation*: The lower the p-value, the less consistent our Null hypothesis is with the observed statistic.

* Ok but how to take a decision then? i.e. decide to reject $H_0$ or not. 

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #4

* To decide wether we reject $H_0$ or not, we set a **significance level** for the test. 

* The **significance level** $\alpha$ is a *cutoff* on the p-value. It's common to assume $\alpha = 5\%$.

* If the p-value falls below the cutoff $\alpha$, we **reject** the null hypothesis on the grounds that ***what we observe is too unlikely to happen*** under the Null.

* Small p-value: The red line is *too far* from the center of the Null distribution. Observing the red line would have happened with very small probability only. 

* Let's illustrate how it works in our example.

* The red area **is the p-value**!

* In our case *more extreme* means *bigger difference* (in favor of men).

* Hence the p-value is the area *more to the right* from our observed stat. 0.292.

* Is that a *big* or a *small* area?

# Obtaining the p-value and Deciding

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p_value <- null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop, direction = "right")
```
    
* The red area, i.e. the p-value, equals **`r p_value`** in our case.

* Under *no discrimination assumption*, there is a `r 100*p_value`% probability to observe a difference in promotion rate superior or equal to 29.2%. 

* Now let's assume we set a 5% significance level, we have $`r 100*p_value` < 0.05$

* So, we can reject $H_0$, i.e. the absence of discrimination, at the 5% significance level. 

  * We also say that $\hat{p_m} - \hat{p_f} = 29.2$% is significantly different from 0 at the 5% level.

* Suppose we had set $\alpha = 0.01 = 1\%$, would we have rejected the absence of discrimination at this level? 

--

* Given that the p-value is *greater* than $\alpha$, i.e. `r 100*p_value[[1,1]]`% > 0.1%, we would **fail to reject** the null $H_0:p_m - p_f = 0$. 

  * The p-value was not sufficiently small to convince us in this case.

# Testing Errors #1

Working with probabilities implies that sometimes, we make **errors**.

* A 29%p difference may be *unlikely* under $H_0$, but that **doesn't mean it's *impossible* to occur**.

  * In fact, we just found that such a difference (or higher) could occur in 1.9% of the cases.

* So, it may happen that we sometimes reject $H_0$, when in fact it was true.

* Setting 5% significance level, you make sure it won't happen more than 5% of the time.

# Testing Errors #2

* In fact, in hypothesis testing, there are even two types of errors to make! ðŸ˜²:

.pull-left[

* Type I error: We Reject a *true* Null.

* Type II error: We *fail* to reject a *wrong* Null.

* In practice, we choose the frequency of a Type I error by setting $\alpha$, called the significance level
