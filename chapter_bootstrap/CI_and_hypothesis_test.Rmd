# Where Did We Stop Last Week?

.pull-left[
* Last week we learned about *sampling distributions*

* We took repeated samples from a population (our pasta bowl) and computed an **estimate** of the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ over and over again

* We took 1000 (!) samples and looked how the sampling distribution evolved as we increased sample sizes from $n=25$ to $n=100$. 

* Our estimates became *more precise* as $n$ increased. 

]

--

.pull-right[
* We introduced notation: 
    * population size $N$, 
    * *point estimate* (like $\hat{p}$), 
    * standard error *of* an estimate

* We said *random sampling produces **unbiased** estimates*.

* Our sample statistics provided **good guesses** about the true population parameters of interest.

# Reality Check

.pull-right[
* Who could ever take **1000** samples for any study?!

* Also, we **knew** the true population proportion of red balls/green Fusilli!

* If we knew in real life, we wouldn't have to take samples altogether, would we?

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun Only?! `r emo::ji("anguished")`. 
]

---

# Real Life Sampling

.pull-left[
* In reality we only get to take **one** sample from the population.

* Still we *know* now that there exists a *sampling distribution*. 

* In other words: we *know* that there is sampling variation.

* With one sample only, how can we know what it looks like?
]

--

.pull-right[
* There are several approaches to construct CI's:
    1. Theory: Use mathematical formulas to derive the sampling distributions for our estimators under certain conditions.
    1. Simulation. We can use the **Bootstrap** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution.
    
* We'll focus on the bootstrap to give you the intuition and come back to the maths approach later.

* But first: what is a *bootstrap*?
]

# Boostrapping our pasta sample #1

* We are working as in real life now, so we have access to *only one random sample*.

  * Here it is:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bowl <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpjsk0rfgc0gx80/pasta.csv?dl=1")
p = mean(bowl$color=="green")
set.seed(5)

my_sample = bowl %>%
  mutate(color = as.factor(ifelse(color == "green","green","non-green"))) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 40) %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)
p_hat = mean(my_sample$color=="green")

bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

percentile_95ci = get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_distrib, level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_95lb = percentile_95ci[[1]]
percentile_95ub = percentile_95ci[[2]]

paste0("ID ", my_sample$pasta_ID, ": ", my_sample$color)
```


* The proportion of green pasta in this sample is: $\hat{p} = `r p_hat`$.

* We are going to resample **WITH REPLACEMENT** from our initial sample.

* ***Intuition***: Our sample becomes our population and we draw samples from it to construct a simulated distribution.

# Boostrapping our pasta sample #2

* How do we get 1 boostrapped sample:
  
  1. Randomly pick one pasta from your sample and record the associated color.
  1. Put this pasta back in your sample and shake up the bowl.
  1. Repeat step 1 to 2 24 times
  1. Compute the bootstrapped sample estimate, e.g. *the proportion of green pasta*

* Here is one bootstrapped sample: 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(5)
one_bootstrapp = my_sample %>%
    ungroup() %>%
  select(pasta_ID, color) %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 40, replace = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(pasta_ID)
paste0("ID ", one_bootstrapp$pasta_ID, ": ", one_bootstrapp$color)
```

* You can notice that:
  * Several pasta have been drawn multiple times (ID=128,149,...)!
  * All have been draw from our initial sample
  * The bootstrapped sample size is equal to our initial sample size. 
---

# Bootstrapping our pasta sample in R



* Repeating the whole procedure 1000 times, you will get 1000 bootsrapped samples and 1000 bootstrapped estimates! 

* We use the `infer` package that makes the whole bootstrapping procedure easier. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %>% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% # generate 1000 boostrapped samples 
  calculate(stat = "prop") # calculate the proportion of green pasta for each
```

.pull-left[
* Here is the first 3 rows:
```{r}

* What `r bootstrap_distrib$stat[2]` is referring to? 

* How many rows has this dataframe?

# Building a 95% confidence interval

.pull-left[

* Let's define an interval that covers 95% of our bootstrapped estimates. 

* We get it by cutting the boostrap distribution at the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles

* It defines our 95% bootstrap CI as: $$CI^B = [q_{2,5\%} ; q_{97,5\%}]$$

* Which in our case gives: $[`r round(percentile_95lb,2)` ; `r  round(percentile_95ub,2)`]$

# Interpreting a 95% confidence interval #1

* Let's first check if the interval we built from our sample contains the true value.

  * Again, in reality we cannot do this check, here we simply show you that we are not loosing our mind. 
  
.pull-left[
</br>

* In our pasta example we have:
$$p = `r round(p,3)`$$

# Recap Confidence Interval

* A CI gives us a range of plausible values for our parameter of interest.

* In order to construct a confidence cnterval, we need: 
  
  1. An underlying **sampling distribution of the estimate**, either boostrapped as in our example, or derived from theory.
  
  2. To specify a **confidence level**, like 90%, 95% etc. 
  
* For the 95% level, we say that we are **95% confident that the interval contains the true parameter** because it actually does in 95% of the cases. 

* *Question* 

  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when setting higher levels of confidence? 
  
  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when the sample size increases?

# Is There Gender Discrimination In Promotions?

.left-wide[
* We will use data from an [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/39f6/d40e907ff08af4ddd3280c2ceee55ee1ddb6.pdf) published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* in 1974 which investigates whether female employees at Banks are discriminated against.

* 48 (male) supervisors were given *identical* candidate CVs - identical up to the first name, which was male or female. 

  * Each CV was "*in the form of a memorandum requesting a decision on the promotion of an employee to the position of branch manager*";

* **Hypothesis** we want to test : *Is there gender discrimination?*

* The data from the experiment are provided in the `promotions` dataset from the `moderndive` package.

1. Then we look how consistent are our data with this hypothesis. 

  * In our case: We gonna ask how likely it is to get a 29%p difference in promotion rate if there is no discrimination.

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions

.pull-left[
* In Hypothesis testing we compare two **competing hypothesis**. 
    * In our example:
        $$\begin{align}H_0:& p_m - p_f = 0\\H_A:& p_m - p_f > 0\end{align}$$
    * $H_0$ stands for the **null hypothesis**, where *no effect* is observed. That's our hypothetical world from above.

* $H_A$ or $H_1$ is the **alternative** hypothesis. Here, we have a *one-sided* alternative, saying that $p_m > p_f$, ie women are discriminated against. The *two-sided* formulation is just $H_A: p_m - p_f \neq 0$

]

--

.pull-right[

* A **test statistic** is a summary statistic which we use to summarise a certain aspect of our sample. Here: $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$

* The *observed test statistic* is the number we get from our real world sample: $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f = 29\%$

* The **null distribution** is the sampling distribution of our test statistic, assuming the Null hypothesis is **true**. That's our hypothetical world without discrimination.

* We have seen such a null distribution just above:

# P-Value and Significance Level $\alpha$

.pull-left[
* The **p-value** is the probability of observing a test statistic *more extreme* than the one we obtained, assuming $H_0$ is true. `r emo::ji("thinking")`

* How *strong* a piece of evidence is it to observe $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f=29\%$ in a world where $p_m - p_f=0$ is assumed true? Very strong? Not so strong?

* Small p-value: The red line is *too far* from the center of the Null distribution. Observing the red line would have happened with very small probability only.

# `infer` Testing Pipeline

.pull-left[

* Here we follow closely the [infer workflow](https://moderndive.com/9-hypothesis-testing.html#infer-workflow-ht) given in moderndive.

* We augment our previous pipeline with the `hypothesize` function, defining the type of null hypothesis.

* Also, we give a `formula` to `specify()` this time, instead of only a variable name as before.

* We create the Null Distribution by *reshuffling* (deck of cards), and *not* by *resampling* (pennies).

.pull-right[
```{r}
null_distribution <- promotions %>% 
  # takes formula, defines success
  specify(formula = decision ~ gender,
          success = "promoted") %>% 
  # decisions are independent of gender
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  # generate 1000 reshufflings of data
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  # compute p_m - p_f from each reshuffle
  calculate(stat = "diff in props",
            order = c("male", "female"))
null_distribution
```

# Back to Reality: What did we *Observe*?

.pull-left[
* We computed $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$ from our *real-world* sample before.


```{r}
obs_diff_prop <- promotions %>% 
  specify(decision ~ gender, success = "promoted") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("male", "female"))
obs_diff_prop
```
]

.pull-right[
* How does that observed statistic compare the distribution of **this** test statistic, assuming that $H_0$ is true?

* We **created** that distribution on the previous slide: `null_distribution`.

* Let's confront `null_distribution` with `obs_diff_prop`, and let's compute the p-value!

# Visualize the Null

.left-wide[
```{r,fig.height=4.5}
visualize(null_distribution, bins = 10)
```
]

.right-thin[
* This is the distribution of $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f$ under $H_0$.

* No Discrimination in that world.
]

---

# Visualize the P-value

.pull-left[
```{r,fig.height=5}
visualize(null_distribution, bins = 10) + 
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop,
                direction = "right")
```
]

.pull-right[
* `shade_p_value` adds the p-value based on `obs_diff_prop`, i.e 0.29.

* `direction = "right"` represents our one-sided alternative $H_A:p_m - p_f > 0$

* *more extreme* means *bigger difference* here, hence *more to the right*.

* If $H_A:p_m - p_f < 0$, we'd set `direction = "left"`

* The red area **is the p-value**!

* Is that a *big* or a *small* area?
]

# Obtaining the p-value and Deciding to Reject

.pull-left[
* Obtain the precise p-value with
    ```{r}
    p_value <- null_distribution %>% 
      get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop, direction = "right")
    p_value
    ```
    
* So, the probability of observing a 29% difference in a world with no discrimination is only `r 100*p_value[[1,1]]`%. That probability is due to sampling variation.
]

--

.pull-right[
* Suppose we had set $\alpha = 0.001 = 0.1\%$

* Given that the p-value is *greater* than $\alpha$, 
    * i.e. `r 100*p_value[[1,1]]`% > 0.1%,
    * we would **fail to reject** the null $H_0:p_m - p_f = 0$. 

* The p-value was not sufficiently small to convince us in this case.

* What would have happened, had we set cutoff $\alpha = 0.05 = 5\%$ instead?

]

---

# Testing Errors

.pull-left[
* Working with probabilities implies that sometimes, we make an error.

* 29% may be *unlikely* under $H_0$, but that doesn't mean it's *impossible* to occur.

* So, it may happen that we sometimes reject $H_0$, when in fact it was true.

]

--

.pull-right[
* This is similar to a verdict reach in a court trial:

![:scale 100%](../img/photos/gt_error_table.png)

* In fact, in hypothesis testing:

# Type I and Type II Errors

.pull-left[
* So, there are even two types of errors to make! 😲

* Type I: We convict an innocent person. We Reject a *true* Null.

* Type II: We *fail* to convict a criminal. We *fail* to reject a *wrong* Null.

* We **choose** the frequency of a Type I error by setting $\alpha$, called the **significance level**.
]

--

.pull-right[
* The probability of committing a type II error is called $\beta$. The value $1-\beta$, i.e. the prob. of *not* making such an error, is called the **power** of a hypothesis test.

* Ideally, $\alpha = \beta = 0$. However, with random sampling this is impossible. Also, both errors are inversely related. (see next slide)

* So, typically we fix $\alpha$ and try to maximize the power of the test. 

* Given a certain frequency of convicting an innocent person, we try to make sure we convict as many true criminals as possible.
]

# Type I and II Errors are Inversely related

.left-wide[
![](../img/photos/power.png)
]

.right-thin[
* $\hat{\theta}$ is *some* test statistic.

* $f(\hat{\theta}|\theta_0)$ and $f(\hat{\theta}|\theta_A)$ are Null and Alternative distributions.

* Changing $\alpha$ moves critical value $\hat{\theta}_c$.

* This example is fully worked out [here](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/images/hypothesis.pdf)
