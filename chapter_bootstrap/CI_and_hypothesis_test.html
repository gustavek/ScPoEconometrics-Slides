# Where Did We Stop Last Week?

.pull-left[
* Last week we learned about *sampling distributions*

* We took repeated samples from a population (our pasta bowl) and computed an **estimate** of the sample proportion `\(\hat{p}\)` over and over again

* We took 1000 (!) samples and looked how the sampling distribution evolved as we increased sample sizes from `\(n=25\)` to `\(n=100\)`. 

* Our estimates became *more precise* as `\(n\)` increased. 

]

--

.pull-right[
* We introduced notation: 
    * population size `\(N\)`, 
    * *point estimate* (like `\(\hat{p}\)`), 
    * standard error *of* an estimate

* We said *random sampling produces **unbiased** estimates*.

* Our sample statistics provided **good guesses** about the true population parameters of interest.

# Reality Check

.pull-right[
* Who could ever take **1000** samples for any study?!

* Also, we **knew** the true population proportion of red balls/green Fusilli!

* If we knew in real life, we wouldn't have to take samples altogether, would we?

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun Only?! ðŸ˜§. 
]

---

# Real Life Sampling

.pull-left[
* In reality we only get to take **one** sample from the population.

* Still we *know* now that there exists a *sampling distribution*. 

* In other words: we *know* that there is sampling variation.

* With one sample only, how can we know what it looks like?
]

--

.pull-right[
* There are several approaches to construct CI's:
    1. Theory: Use mathematical formulas to derive the sampling distributions for our estimators under certain conditions.
    1. Simulation. We can use the **Bootstrap** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution.
    
* We'll focus on the bootstrap to give you the intuition and come back to the maths approach later.

* But first: what is a *bootstrap*?
]

# Boostrapping our pasta sample #1

* We are working as in real life now, so we have access to *only one random sample*.

  * Here it is:


```
##  [1] "ID 8: green"       "ID 54: non-green"  "ID 71: green"      "ID 85: green"     
##  [5] "ID 92: non-green"  "ID 122: green"     "ID 123: non-green" "ID 128: non-green"
##  [9] "ID 146: green"     "ID 149: green"     "ID 184: green"     "ID 192: non-green"
## [13] "ID 207: non-green" "ID 222: green"     "ID 235: non-green" "ID 248: green"    
## [17] "ID 269: non-green" "ID 326: green"     "ID 365: non-green" "ID 387: non-green"
## [21] "ID 394: non-green" "ID 403: green"     "ID 404: green"     "ID 407: green"    
## [25] "ID 457: non-green" "ID 463: non-green" "ID 464: green"     "ID 468: green"    
## [29] "ID 474: green"     "ID 491: non-green" "ID 503: green"     "ID 512: green"    
## [33] "ID 528: green"     "ID 539: non-green" "ID 616: non-green" "ID 625: green"    
## [37] "ID 628: green"     "ID 665: non-green" "ID 695: green"     "ID 697: non-green"
```


* The proportion of green pasta in this sample is: `\(\hat{p} = 0.55\)`.

* We are going to resample **WITH REPLACEMENT** from our initial sample.

* ***Intuition***: Our sample becomes our population and we draw samples from it to construct a simulated distribution.

# Boostrapping our pasta sample #2

* How do we get 1 boostrapped sample:
  
  1. Randomly pick one pasta from your sample and record the associated color.
  1. Put this pasta back in your sample and shake up the bowl.
  1. Repeat step 1 to 2 24 times
  1. Compute the bootstrapped sample estimate, e.g. *the proportion of green pasta*

* Here is one bootstrapped sample: 


```
##  [1] "ID 54: non-green"  "ID 71: green"      "ID 122: green"     "ID 123: non-green"
##  [5] "ID 128: non-green" "ID 128: non-green" "ID 146: green"     "ID 149: green"    
##  [9] "ID 149: green"     "ID 184: green"     "ID 192: non-green" "ID 207: non-green"
## [13] "ID 235: non-green" "ID 235: non-green" "ID 235: non-green" "ID 248: green"    
## [17] "ID 248: green"     "ID 248: green"     "ID 326: green"     "ID 365: non-green"
## [21] "ID 387: non-green" "ID 387: non-green" "ID 394: non-green" "ID 394: non-green"
## [25] "ID 394: non-green" "ID 403: green"     "ID 404: green"     "ID 457: non-green"
## [29] "ID 463: non-green" "ID 463: non-green" "ID 464: green"     "ID 464: green"    
## [33] "ID 468: green"     "ID 468: green"     "ID 468: green"     "ID 491: non-green"
## [37] "ID 616: non-green" "ID 628: green"     "ID 665: non-green" "ID 697: non-green"
```

* You can notice that:
  * Several pasta have been drawn multiple times (ID=128,149,...)!
  * All have been draw from our initial sample
  * The bootstrapped sample size is equal to our initial sample size. 
---

# Bootstrapping our pasta sample in R



* Repeating the whole procedure 1000 times, you will get 1000 bootsrapped samples and 1000 bootstrapped estimates! 

* We use the `infer` package that makes the whole bootstrapping procedure easier. 


```r
bootstrap_distrib = my_sample %&gt;% # take my random sample
  specify(response = color, success = "green") %&gt;% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;% # generate 1000 boostrapped samples 
  calculate(stat = "prop") # calculate the proportion of green pasta for each
```

.pull-left[
* Here is the first 3 rows:

```r
head(bootstrap_distrib,3)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2

## 3         3 0.5

* What 0.45 is referring to? 

* How many rows has this dataframe?

# Building a 95% confidence interval

.pull-left[

* Let's define an interval that covers 95% of our bootstrapped estimates. 

* We get it by cutting the boostrap distribution at the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles

* It defines our 95% bootstrap CI as: `$$CI^B = [q_{2,5\%} ; q_{97,5\%}]$$`

* Which in our case gives: `\([0.4 ; 0.7]\)`

# Interpreting a 95% confidence interval #1

* Let's first check if the interval we built from our sample contains the true value.

  * Again, in reality we cannot do this check, here we simply show you that we are not loosing our mind. 
  
.pull-left[
&lt;/br&gt;

* In our pasta example we have:
`$$p = 0.494$$`

* So yes, the true value is indeed in our 95% interval! 

* Ok but, what does ***95% confidence*** actually means?

.pull-left[

* Let's imagine we had another sample from the begining, we would have obtained a different 95% CI.

  * Would this CI contained the true `\(p\)`?

* Let's now take 100 different samples drawn from our initial *bowl*

  * For each compute the associated 95% CI
  
  * As you can see, there are 5 of them whhich miss the true `\(p\)` = 0.493

* **That's define a 95% Confidence Interval**

# Recap Confidence Interval

* A CI gives us a range of plausible values for our parameter of interest.

* In order to construct a confidence cnterval, we need: 
  
  1. An underlying **sampling distribution of the estimate**, either boostrapped as in our example, or derived from theory.
  
  2. To specify a **confidence level**, like 90%, 95% etc. 
  
* For the 95% level, we say that we are **95% confident that the interval contains the true parameter** because it actually does in 95% of the cases. 

* *Question* 

  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when setting higher levels of confidence? 
  
  * How does the size of the confidence interval evolves when the sample size increases?

# Is There Gender Discrimination In Promotions?

.left-wide[
* We will use data from an [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/39f6/d40e907ff08af4ddd3280c2ceee55ee1ddb6.pdf) published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* in 1974 which investigates whether female employees at Banks are discriminated against.

* 48 (male) supervisors were given *identical* candidate CVs - identical up to the first name, which was male or female. 

  * Each CV was "*in the form of a memorandum requesting a decision on the promotion of an employee to the position of branch manager*";

* **Hypothesis** we want to test : *Is there gender discrimination?*

* The data from the experiment are provided in the `promotions` dataset from the `moderndive` package.

  * 87.5% of "men" were promoted.
  * 58.3% of "women" were promoted.


* *Question*: Is the 29%p advantage for men **conclusive evidence**? 

  * Could we have observed a 29% difference *by chance*?

# Hypothesis testing: Basic idea 

The idea of hypothesis tests is quite simple: 

1. We asusme that the hypothesis we want to test is true. 

  * In our case: There is no gender discrimination in promotions. 

1. Then we look how consistent are our data in this world. 

  * In our case: We gonna ask how likely it is to get a 29%p difference in promotion rate if there is no discrimination.

# Imposing A Hypothetical World: No Gender Discriminiation

.pull-left[
* Suppose we lived in a world without gender discrimination.

* The promotion decision would be completely independent from gender.

  * The label `gender` in our dataframe would be meaningless.

* Let's randomly reassign `gender` to each row and see how this affects the result.

  * This is what has been done to obtain the `promotions_shuffled` dataset

# Sampling Variation?

* In our hypothetical world, the difference was only 4.2%p.

* So can we answer our initial question about the existence of gender discrimination now? 

--

* We must look at the role of *sampling variation*? 

  * What if we reshuffle once again, how different from 4.2%p the difference would be?
  * In other words, how representative of that hypothetical world is 4.2%?
  * Relatedly, how likely a 29%p difference is going to occur in such a world? 

* We need to know about the whole sampling distribution of this difference under the *no discrimination* hypothesis. 

* How? Just by redoing the reshuffling a large number of times, computing the difference each time.

# Recap

* We observed a 29%p difference in promotion rate between women and men in the real world.

* Even if promotions had been randomly allocated between men and women, a difference would have been observed.

* The question is whether in a hypothetical universe with no discrimination, 29%p is *likely* to occur.

* We concluded *rather not*, i.e. we tended to **reject** that hypothesis.

* So, we conducted our first hypothesis test! 

  * We actually did a **permutation test**. We randomly reshuffled gender accross promotion decisions and checked if it makes a difference.

* Let's introduce the formal framework of hypothesis test now. 

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #1

* In Hypothesis testing we compare two **competing hypothesis** about our parameter of interest. 
    * In the previous example:
        `$$\begin{align}H_0:&amp; p_m - p_f = 0\\H_A:&amp; p_m - p_f &gt; 0\end{align}$$`

* `\(H_0\)` stands for the **null hypothesis**, where *no effect* is observed. That's our hypothetical world from above.

* `\(H_A\)` or `\(H_1\)` is the **alternative** hypothesis. 
  * Here, we considered a *one-sided* alternative, saying that `\(p_m &gt; p_f\)`, ie women are discriminated against.
  * The *two-sided* formulation is just `\(H_A: p_m - p_f \neq 0\)`

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #2

* A **test statistic** is a summary statistic which we use to summarise a certain aspect of our sample. 
  * In our previous case it was: `\(\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f\)`

* The *observed test statistic* is the number we get from our real world sample: 
`$$\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f = 29.2\%$$`

* The **null distribution** is the sampling distribution of our test statistic, assuming the Null hypothesis is **true**. 
  *  All the possible values that `\(\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f\)` assuming there is no discrimination.

  * That's the distribution we have seen just before. 
 
---

# Null Distribution

.left-wide[
&lt;img src="CI_and_hypothesis_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.right-thin[
&lt;/br&gt;
* This **is** the sampling distribution of `\(\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f\)`, assuming `\(H_0\)` is true.

* The red line is the *observed* test statistic.
]

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #3

* The **p-value** is the probability of observing a test statistic *more extreme* than the one we obtained, assuming `\(H_0\)` is true. ðŸ¤”

  * How *strong* a piece of evidence is it to observe `\(\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f=29\%\)` in a world where `\(p_m - p_f=0\)` is assumed true? Very strong? Not so strong?

  * How many samples did we obtain that had a difference *greater* than 29%? Many, or not so many?

* The p-value measures the probability to the right of the red line in the previous plot.

* *Interpretation*: The lower the p-value, the less consistent our Null hypothesis is with the observed statistic.

* So, how to make a decision then? 

---

# Hypothesis Test Notation and Definitions #4

* To decide if we reject `\(H_0\)` or not (i.e. binary decision) we set a **significance level** for the test. 

* The **significance level** `\(\alpha\)` is a *cutoff* on the p-value. It's common to assume `\(\alpha = 5\%\)`.

  * We choose it *before* conducting our hypothesis test. 

* If the p-value falls below the cutoff `\(\alpha\)`, we **reject** the null hypothesis on the grounds that ***what we observe is too unlikely to happen*** under the Null.

* Small p-value: The red line is *too far* from the center of the Null distribution. Observing the red line would have happened with very small probability only.

* *more extreme* means *bigger difference* here, hence *more to the right*.

* If `\(H_A:p_m - p_f \neq 0\)`, we'd set `direction = "both"`

* The red area **is the p-value**!

* Is that a *big* or a *small* area?

    ##     &lt;dbl&gt;
    ## 1   0.023

* So, the probability of observing a 29% difference in a world with no discrimination is only 2.3%. That probability is due to sampling variation.

* So, it may happen that we sometimes reject `\(H_0\)`, when in fact it was true.

* This is similar to a verdict reach in a court trial:

# Type I and Type II Errors

.pull-left[
* So, there are even two types of errors to make! ðŸ˜²

* Type I: We convict an innocent person. We Reject a *true* Null.

* Type II: We *fail* to convict a criminal. We *fail* to reject a *wrong* Null.

* We **choose** the frequency of a Type I error by setting `\(\alpha\)`, called the **significance level**.
]

--

.pull-right[
* The probability of committing a type II error is called `\(\beta\)`. The value `\(1-\beta\)`, i.e. the prob. of *not* making such an error, is called the **power** of a hypothesis test.

* Ideally, `\(\alpha = \beta = 0\)`. However, with random sampling this is impossible. Also, both errors are inversely related. (see next slide)

* So, typically we fix `\(\alpha\)` and try to maximize the power of the test. 

* Given a certain frequency of convicting an innocent person, we try to make sure we convict as many true criminals as possible.
